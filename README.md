🧭 About This Project

This is my first-ever portfolio website, created back when I was just figuring out how to make something show up in the browser 😄
No frameworks. No advanced tools.
Just HTML, pure curiosity, and a big dream ✨

This project reminds me:

🌱 Where I started

🧠 How much I’ve grown

🔥 Why I should never stop learning

🛠️ What I Used

🧾 HTML — my first step into the coding world

🎨 A curious mind & a lot of trial and error

💪 Beginner energy and persistence

📚 What I Learned

How to structure a simple webpage

How one line of code can bring ideas to life

That small projects create strong foundations

💬 A Note to Myself (Past & Future)

🪞 Past Me: You started. That’s what matters most.
🚀 Future Me: Never forget this spark. Keep leveling up.
🧑‍💻 To Anyone Starting Out: Every great developer was once right here. Keep going. 🙌

✨ Final Thoughts

This project may be simple — but it’s a milestone.
Today, I build bigger things, but this little site will always remind me of how it all began 💙
